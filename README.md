# evolutionary-algorithm-for-TSP
Scripted a Python program using Evolutionary algorithm to solve Traveling Salesman Problem

Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) are based on concepts of biological evolution. A population of possible solutions to the problem is first created with each solution being scored using a fitness function that indicates how good they are. The population evolves over time and (hopefully) identifies better solutions.

Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, Find the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city.
